## Abstract ##

Currently, Android applications are becoming more and more popular but almost 
all Android developers will face to a large number of issues reports every day, and 
then developers will debug their code based on the issue reports posted by other 
users. Therefore, analyzing those issue reports of Android apps hosted on GitHub 
has huge positive effects on Android API development. In the project, based on 
issue reports text hosted on GitHub, the textRank algorithm and BERT model in 
the machine learning is used to obtain summaries with a large number issue report. 
According to comparison of the performance of the two models, although BERT 
can be said state-of-the-art in NLP techniques, there is still no steady improvement 
on TextRank in the quality of summaries and combining context.

Thanks to all my friends for their encouragement and support. Thanks to Khadija Osman for helping me to download and understand data. Thanks to Ryan Taylor for providing me with a virtual machine with extremely excellent performance. Special thanks my supervisor Dr. Olga Baysal for her very useful paper of textRank algorithm, responding to my email, answering questions and solving many difficulties rapidly when I was in trouble. She also spent much time in meeting with me and discuss about my honours project, which helped me determine the next steps for my research.
