startActivity,"No. Android Does *Not* Have a Crop Intent. Look at this post No, Android Does Not Have a Crop Intent Many developers are calling startActivity   on an Intent with an action of com.android.camera.action.CROP. They are doing this to crop an image. This is a really bad idea. Any time you find yourself typing or pasting something starting with com.android, warning bells should be sounding. Better yet, the “Lost in Space” Robot should amble toward you, waving his arms, shouting “Danger, Will Robinson. Danger.”  note  while your name may not be Will Robinson, if a robot is flailing about in your vicinity, just play along, m’kay.  In this specific case, this Intent action is supported by the AOSP Camera app. That app does not exist on all devices. Devices lacking this app will not respond to this undocumented Intent action, and your app will crash. There are several open source libraries for cropping images in Android. I have not tried any of them, and therefore cannot vouch for how well any work. However, they are safer bets than relying upon an undocumented Intent action from an app that may not exist on any given user’s device. It seems that using the so called System Crop Action  com.android.camera.action.CROPis not a wise choice."

onSaveInstanceState,"Persisting stack state. Unlike traditional god-activity / god-fragment approaches we do not really need to worry about persisting state on config change or activity tear-down when in the background, which cuts out a high % of state saving. We do however need to consider the case where process-death occurs and we want the application to be in a similar state to where we left it on return. This issue is regarding the manner in which to save the stack. As I see it we have 2 options Serialize the stack  or parcel  Use a primitive representation of the stack In turn will briefly talk about these. Serialize the stack  or parcel  Advantages Preserves callbacks between stack objects Can create frames directly via constructor with input args and anon callbacks  for any frame that requires a result  could save the frames ViewState for free.  this may actually be useless as of course we cannot save the async ops that may be running and therefore the viewstate may show  Loading  when nothing actually is. Deserializing the stack is very simple Disadvantages Could be quite slow with large stack and frames Need to mark all fields and inner classes  and anon  inside frame as Serializable or transient Would need to have tests covering the serializability of each frame as otherwise easy way for crashes to sneak in Use a primitive representation of the stack This is much like the approach that Activitys and Fragments already use i.e. take a Parcelable Bundle that represents the inputs  and potentially any loaded data  used to start a frame and persist this. This makes it easy to reload the application to a very similar state to what it was when the process was killed. Advantages Simpler as only saves Bundle and frame class name. Do not have to mark everything up as Serializable or transient Disadvantages Would need to reimplement a similar kind of bundle saving / stack recreation as AOSP uses for activities / fragments. Would probably use reflection and no-arg / single arg frame constructors. makes passing data bit more verbose as have to pass keys and primative values through  unless scoped data is being referenced  Notes makes callbacks more verbose as cannot pass anon classes through but rather would need a pushFrameForResult CallbackToFrameClass, requestCode  kind of approach...to make this simpler could follow a pattern of having a calling frame implementing a result interface which is then pulled from the stack when a result is ready  looking at the stack item below the one passing the result and checking if it conforms to the correct interface .This would still work after dead-process recreation and would avoid the result codes and request code stuff from current AOSP Activity solutions. Would also need to allow arbritrary stuff to be saved in bundle aka onSaveInstanceState Conclusion Primitive stack representation makes more sense due to the pros and cons above. Implementation Callbacks Going will a manual inspect stack and pull frame with callback interface approach. Primitive bundle To support this PilotFrame subclasses need to be able to have a Bundle delivered to them. Either a construtor arg called via super   or an initBundle   method. May use a no-arg constructor in PilotFrame that throws an error as the bundle constructor should explitly be called - this will protect against subclasses forgetting to call super. Bundles should be passed to optional onSave and onRestore methods by the stack on process death / recreation PilotStack should handle grabbing the Frame type and bundle and storing this for stack persistence on process death."

onCreate,关于引用该项目遇到的一些问题.以及解决办法. 1.设置左滑之后，下滑禁止不掉这个问题是因为你的Activity即继承了SwipeBackActivity，Activity的布局中又加上了SwipeBackLayout。解决办法是要么继承SwipeBackActivity，然后在onCreate直接setDragEdge  设置；要么再布局文件中加上SwipeBackLayout，然后在Activty里调用SwipeBackLayout的setDragEdge  方法；两者只能选一个。2.Activity中有webview或者ListView、Recyclerview等可以上下拖动的控件时，侧滑很容易被触发。这个问题是滑动冲突照成的，位于底部的SwipeBackLayout拦截了子View的触摸事件。所以我们要做的是继承SwipeBackLayout重写它的onInterceptTouchEvent  方法，当手指在Y轴的移动速度大于X轴的移动速度时不拦截这个触摸事件，代码如下

onCreate,"Fragment Support. urrently only supports View based architectures and old school dialogs. Would be good to extend support to Fragments and FragmentDialogs. Due to the SRP #14 refactors UITypeHandlers can now be registered for differnt UI types  i.e. Views, Dialogs, Fragments etc , this leaves the challenges around... 1.Working out where in the Fragments lifecycle is safe to start using the Presenter. 2.Working out where in the DialogFragments lifecycle is safe to start using the Presenter. This has an extra constraint due to where onCreateDialog   is called 3.An example of how to align the foregound view for an Activity that used both a UIViewTypeHandler and a UIFragmentTypeHandler Ideally Fragments onCreateView would have access to the Presenter so any views can be initialised with frame based data. This needs to be true for a  newly placed fragments b  fragments that have been recreated after a config-change Need to keep in in mind the horror that is http //staticfree.info/~steve/complete_android_fragment_lifecycle.png. Ideally would not use fragments at all but sometimes one needs to  say a 3rd party lib that supplied part of its SDK pre-bundled as a fragment  On Fragment recreation - cant really reliably push the Presenter to the Fragment before onCreateView is called, as this is called as a result of Activity.setContentView, inside of which is also the fragment recreation step.  http //grepcode.com/file_/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/5.1.1_r1/com/android/internal/policy/impl/PhoneWindow.java/.v=source  delegates to https //android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/transition/Scene.java delegates to https //android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/heads/master/core/java/android/view/LayoutInflater.java May resort to Fragments needing to operate on a Pull fashion instead of Push  Views have their presenters pushed to them on creation . inside Fragment.onCreateView and FragmentDialog.onCreateDialog the first call could grab the corresponding Presenter from the hosting Activitys PilotStack. It would also need to cope with the event that the frame is no longer top of the pilot stack, in which case the fragment should dismiss itself asap. Beginning to think to not bother - an arbritrary fragment can be shown using the GenericUITypeHandler and handled manually... EDIT  maybe we dont have to worry about fragment recreation if the UIFragmentTypeManager is just using the FragmentTransaction.replace   method anyway. If fragment state restoration is handled in the same was as Views may should still restore fragment test, Test. Just done some testing - if we use replace with the same fragment the state is not saved by default - if not using replace then the presenter is after onCreateView... Think will need to just pull the presenter  if not already set  and if its not the top of the stack then it will auto be switched out by the top of stack callback that will follow the root Activitys.setContentView call. Then all need to do is ensure what ever UITypeHandlers that are being used will clear each other / take priority. Was thinking a Fragment can pull from the top of the stack using its @Presenter annotation to declare what presenter its interested in. If the top of the stack is a different presenter/frame null will be passed. This can be ignored and the fragment would build no UI in this case - as its about to be switched out anyway  it no longer represents the top of the stack . This wont work at current as after process death we may have some fragments recreated but the PilotLifeCycleManager has its onCreateDelegate called after Activity.setContentView. This is intentional as we need to pass the PilotSyncer in here, which can reference part of the UI  see UITypeViewDisplayer . If going this route would need to ensure that the PilotStack was already accessible by the point setContentView is called. This could be done by delegating two calls to PilotLifecycleDelegate inside Activity.onCreate, one before setContentView which just uses the savedStateBundle to restore the stack, and one after that passes the ui hooked up PilotSyncer"

onCreate,"Slow operations in UI thread. Dear developers, I am studying android-wifi-tether using a static code checker. I found some potential slow operations in android-wifi-tether s UI thread. Android documentation says this  http //developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-anr.html  Any method that runs in the UI thread should do as little work as possible on that thread. In particular, activities should do as little as possible in key life-cycle methods such as onCreate   and onResume  . Potentially long running operations such as network or database operations, or computationally expensive calculations such as resizing bitmaps should be done in a worker thread  e.g., via AsyncTask .  I found the following event handlers performing file IO or remote data reading  com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether.AccessControlActivity s onClick   handler at line 80  file reading and deleting com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether.SetupActivity s onCreate   handler  file reading and input stream zipping com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether.LogActivity s onCreate   handler  file reading and data loading from an URL com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether.AccessControlActivity s onCreate    file reading Do you think these slow operations will affect android-wifi-tether s performance  e.g., making GUI not smooth enough . If yes, perhaps moving them to a separate thread can help make android-wifi-tether super smooth in user interaction. Looking forward to your reply and hope I can help improve android-wifi-tether."

onCreate,"MonitoringInstrumentation leaking activity instances through ExecutorService. Library  com.android.support.test testing-support-lib Version  0.1 TL,DR  on Android   5.0, activity instances may be leaked for at most 60 seconds by MonitoringInstrumentation after an activity started with MonitoringInstrumentation#startActivitySync is destroyed. The fix is a one line change in MonitoringInstrumentation#onCreate  . I found this through a heap dump, here s what s going on  * MonitoringInstrumentation#onCreate creates a thread pool executor using Executors.newCachedThreadPool  , * MonitoringInstrumentation.startActivitySync   posts a Future Activity . That ends up creating a FutureTask that has its  outcome  field set to an activity. In an ideal world, once the FutureTask is completed it gets garbage collected and will therefore release the reference it has to the activity through the  outcome  field . However, *prior to Android 5*, threads looping and blocking on queues may keep a reference to stack local variables until the queue unblock. Here s what I mean  while true  { Foo foo = blockingQueue.next  , foo.doSomething  , } Say blockingQueue only contains one thing and then stays empty. The loop will execute once and then block on next  . However, the first foo instance will never be garbage collected, because it s help as a stack local variable until the queue unblocks. It s a VM optimization that creates temporary memory leaks. This impacts any thread + blocking mechanism  thread pool executors, HandlerThread, etc  on Android versions less than 5  can t repro on 5 . This is the same bug as this  https //github.com/square/picasso/pull/932 Because MonitoringInstrumentation uses Executors.newCachedThreadPool   so that s a core pool of 0 and a keep alive of 60 seconds. This means any thread that becomes idle will stay around for 60 seconds before being garbage collected. So if we call MonitoringInstrumentation.startActivitySync  , the thread cool creates a thread to handle the FutureTask that will create the activity. Once that future task is done, the thread becomes idle. However, prior to Android 5.0, it keeps a stack local reference to the future task, and therefore prevents the activity from being garbage collected  until that thread is reused for another future task, or GCed after 60 seconds . The fix here is to configure the ThreadPoolExecutor so that threads are immediately killed when they become idle. It s not great, but it should be ok for instrumentation tests."

finish,"[Feature] Add the game Dimaryp. RULESWith a standard 52-card deck  no jokers , start by dealing a row of 7 cards face up laid side by side. The remaining cards you try to play face-up on to the row of 7, first a row of 6, then 5, etc. You can start working on your shorter rows  as they connect  before you finish the longer ones. It ends up looking like a pyramid unless you build down ... then it s an upside-down pyramid. So after you deal the first 7, you turn over the next card from the deck and try to play it somewhere on the first row. You lay it down so that it s overlapping on 2 of the 7. The card you play and the 2 cards you play it on make a set of 3 cards. The set of 3 cards must be all the same suit, the same number, or a run of consecutive numbers  like 7-8-9  in any order. Examples  8-7-6, Q-10-J, 3-4-2. Aces are wild and they can have multiple identities in relation to the cards around them. Deuces and kings are not considered to be consecutive. There is one other set of 3 that is allowed. It is acceptable if the card you play is the same suit as one card, and the same number as the other. For example, if you have a 3 of spades next to a king of hearts, you can lay a 3 of hearts on them  or a king of spades . If you can t find a place to play a card, you put it in a face-up discard pile. The top card on the discard pile can be used if it later becomes playable. You can choose to not play a card that is playable. Sometimes this is advisable when considering future prospects in the next row. You keep playing cards until you build an upside-down  or right-side-up  pyramid with a final row of 1. If you can do that before running out of cards, you win. Count your remaining cards to determine your score."

I am using the app for my strength workouts, but I can see this applying for people who track their cardio and want to constantly improve themselves.The way I work out and my current problem  I start my programs out with lighter weights, then as I work out and push myself in the gym, I constantly try to increase. If I lift more weights one week, I would like that next time I do a specific program I start off at the same point.In other words, the feature is to automatically increase the weight used for an exercise based off what was completed previously.Example Program  Monday  has an exercise  Bench Press  and it is set for 6 reps at a weight of 135 lbs. As I complete the program, I end up pushing more  lets say 6 reps at 155 lbs  and this is logged in the app. When the user finishes the workout and clicks on  Finish Program , the program automatically gets adjusted with the max weight completed. So next time the user does  Monday , the program will ask for 155 lbs instead of the original 135 lbs.I would have that added as a new setting which the user can turn on or off as they wish.Some things that I though of and can be open for discussion Should the weight only increase if the user completed the requested number of reps. From the example above, if the user only did 5 reps of 155, should it still increase the weight of the program or keep it as-is.  I think I would keep the weight until reps are achieved Should we simply have a new popup/dialog that asks the users which ones to update. That way even if the user did lift more, he can choose not to update his program, or maybe he will have checkboxes and be able to select which ones to update and which ones to leave.I am new to the code but I can start looking into this if no one opposes."
