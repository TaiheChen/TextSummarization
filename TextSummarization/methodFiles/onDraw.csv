"You could extend ColorCircle with a new field  private float size, and store the size of each circle."
You have this value available in both Renderer classes.
This way it is easier to draw a border around the currently selected circle.
I find it nicer with a single black circle with 3.0f stroke with around the selected one.
Also this way you can skip some calculation logic in onDraw   function of ColorPickerView.
"I use it like this  float size = Math.max minimumSelectedCircleSize, currentColorCircle.getSize   , where minimumSelectedCircleSize is defined at init."
"Good luck, very nice library by the way."
