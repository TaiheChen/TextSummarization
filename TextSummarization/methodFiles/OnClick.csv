https://api.github.com/repos/iammert/MaterialIntroView,https://github.com/iammert/MaterialIntroView/issues/72,onClick,"Multiple run of onClickListener body. And this problem: when I press on showcase circle to close it, the next shows - it's how that must work, but if I press on showcase cirle several times it starts the next showcase cirle one over another, so I might have completely black screen with white circle (about 5-10 overlays of showcase). I use this lib for several fragments. So, on this fragment I need showcase to work like this: whenever I press, the showcase must dismiss instantly. On other fragments, I need to press inside the circle restricfuly. I need help: how to not to let next showcase being shown more then once?"

I'd like to be able to either choose a random color (from the palette aka the colored dots of the wheel) or to be able to get the array of the colors displayed on the wheel (so that I can use a generated random number to pick a color by myself) I'd like to set initialColor to the random color and use the same random color (at the same time I call initialColor, not only when setPositiveButton's onClick is called) Is this possible?"

Hello ï¼ Thank you very much for sharing your results, And saved me a lot of time, Thank you very much againl, but, I found some problems, When I say item listens for an event, When the sliding view has no fingers, It triggers an onClick event directly to the view, So l'd like to make a suggestion, Define a Boolean type variable, in setCanAutoRotation, False in ACTION_DOWN from setCanAutoRotation, true in ACTION_MOVE, The onClick event of the subview in the checkChildView then determines that the Boolean type variable is false, To enter the onItemClick event. I hope you can see my lssues. Wish you a happy life."
https://api.github.com/repos/eddietseng/Flickster,https://github.com/eddietseng/Flickster/issues/1,onClick,"Project 1: Flicks - Ready for Review. My app is complete, please review. /cc @codepathreview @codepath Also, I have questions as listed below. Is setImageResource(0) needed before setting the ImageView? I've tried both ways of implementing the onClickListener in ViewHolder. One way is to implement a custom OnClickListener Interface and pass the event to the Activity, and the other way is to implement View.OnClickListener for ViewHolder. I was wondering which way is the better approach. I also realized startActivityforResult() can't be called if the ViewHolder implements View.OnClickListener. Is that mean I should use the custom OnClickListener Interface approach if i want to return data from the previous Activity? I also have question about the timing of getting the data from network. For example, pulling trailer YouTube key can be done before moving to the next Activity or at the next Activity. For some reason I can't get the second approach to work (pulling trailer at the next Activity). Is there a way to do data binding for views inside a ViewHolder? Thanks."

What steps will reproduce the problem? 1. create dialog with custom view and OnGlobalLayoutListener 2. change LayoutParams inside onGlobalLayout 3. create espresso test which try to click on the dialog buttons What is the expected output? What do you see instead? Expect: espresso clicks on the dialog buttons Instead: espresso misses the dialog buttons and onClick method not called. What version of the product are you using? Espresso 2.2 Please provide any additional information below. I create test project for this issue, you can find it here: https://github.com/moonsweel/onGlobalLayout-espresso If start MainActivityTest as it is, onClick method of Save button will not be called... But if you comment layout LayoutParams changing it works as it should. Also if make LayoutParams changes outside of onGlobalLayout(), but before showing dialog, the test also works fine. Best regards."
