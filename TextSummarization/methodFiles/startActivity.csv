Android Does *Not* Have a Crop Intent.
"Look at this post No, Android Does Not Have a Crop Intent Many developers are calling startActivity   on an Intent with an action of com.android.camera.action.CROP."
They are doing this to crop an image.
This is a really bad idea.
"Any time you find yourself typing or pasting something starting with com.android, warning bells should be sounding."
"Better yet, the “Lost in Space” Robot should amble toward you, waving his arms, shouting “Danger, Will Robinson."
"Danger.”  note  while your name may not be Will Robinson, if a robot is flailing about in your vicinity, just play along, m’kay."
"In this specific case, this Intent action is supported by the AOSP Camera app."
That app does not exist on all devices.
"Devices lacking this app will not respond to this undocumented Intent action, and your app will crash."
There are several open source libraries for cropping images in Android.
"I have not tried any of them, and therefore cannot vouch for how well any work."
"However, they are safer bets than relying upon an undocumented Intent action from an app that may not exist on any given user’s device."
It seems that using the so called System Crop Action  com.android.camera.action.CROPis not a wise choice.
"How to Use Detector on Full Camera Image and How to Use Front-Facing Camera.. Hi, What code do I need to change in order to use the full-size image for the face detector and also for drawing the bounding box and landmarks."
"I tried changing the face detector to use the full size bitmap as so.results = mFaceDet.detect mRGBframeBitmap , However, the face detector is completely unable to detect a face."
Please advise.
"Also, do you know how I would change the code to use the front-facing camera."
I m very new to Android but found this suggested code snippet.
Wrap Share Intent with Chooser.
In the java land you re just passing a basic Share Intent which throws up an option to set the default share action.
This could cause a user to lock them into sharing with one app.

Test hangs and timeout on setUp  GoogleInstumentation  ActivityFinisher  leaks activities between tests.
What steps will reproduce the problem.
Create Test1 which goes from Activity A to Activity B to Activity C. 2 Create Test 2 which does the same.
3  Check the Activity Stack when Test 1 ends What is the expected output.
What do you see instead.
Test2 will start and Activity B is still on the Stack.
What version of the product are you using.
On what operating system.
Please provide any additional information below.
This can result in test hanging between each other and failing with a timeout on startActivitySync.
A fix is proposed and pushed here https //code.google.com/r/luigimassagallerano-googleinstr/source/detail.r=0 bd56035ad407e061064e6ba2b5dec3df33a1887
