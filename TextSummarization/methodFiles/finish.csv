Dismiss and pass the touch event to underlaying view on touch down.
Is it possible to dismiss MaterialIntroView and pass the touch event to underlaying view on touch down.
The reason I need this is that I am using MaterialIntroView to explain that it is possible to swipe a view holder in a view pager.
When the user finished reading the description their first action is often to try to swipe the view.
"But since MaterialIntroView is still visible it will consume the first touch event, I want to pass this touch swipe event to my view holder so it can be swiped and MaterialIntroView dismissed at the same time."

"My name is Maheetha, and I m a student at a lab at Stanford trying to use WASP for allele-specific expression purposes."
I have a couple of bugs that I was hoping you might have the answer for.
I have everything set up as according to the README file and have all of the SNPs separated by chromosome in a separate directory.
"When I run find_intersecting_snps.py, it finishes chr1, chr10, and chr11 sucessfully."
"During chr11, it doesn t say that it  skips any SNPs , but it skipped SNPs for chr1 and chr10."
"However, I think the bigger issues is that it finishes after chr11 and doesn t do chr12 or any other chromosome for that matter."
"When I try to do chr8 by itself or start from chr12  so I remove chr1, chr10, and chr11 from the snp directory  it gives me this error."

[Feature] Add the game Dimaryp.
"RULESWith a standard 52-card deck  no jokers , start by dealing a row of 7 cards face up laid side by side."
"The remaining cards you try to play face-up on to the row of 7, first a row of 6, then 5, etc."
You can start working on your shorter rows  as they connect  before you finish the longer ones.
It ends up looking like a pyramid unless you build down ... then it s an upside-down pyramid.
"So after you deal the first 7, you turn over the next card from the deck and try to play it somewhere on the first row."
You lay it down so that it s overlapping on 2 of the 7.
The card you play and the 2 cards you play it on make a set of 3 cards.
"The set of 3 cards must be all the same suit, the same number, or a run of consecutive numbers  like 7-8-9  in any order."
"Examples  8-7-6, Q-10-J, 3-4-2."
Aces are wild and they can have multiple identities in relation to the cards around them.
Deuces and kings are not considered to be consecutive.
There is one other set of 3 that is allowed.
"It is acceptable if the card you play is the same suit as one card, and the same number as the other."
"For example, if you have a 3 of spades next to a king of hearts, you can lay a 3 of hearts on them  or a king of spades ."
"If you can t find a place to play a card, you put it in a face-up discard pile."
The top card on the discard pile can be used if it later becomes playable.
You can choose to not play a card that is playable.
Sometimes this is advisable when considering future prospects in the next row.
You keep playing cards until you build an upside-down  or right-side-up  pyramid with a final row of 1.
"If you can do that before running out of cards, you win."
Count your remaining cards to determine your score.

play all files in a folder.
"Currently only 1 file plays, would be nice if when playing a file in a folder  album  when it finishes, move on to play the next one.I m guessing this will require hooking into a callback that fires when tracks finish playing - not sure if there is anything like that in the src at the moment."

Feature Request  Auto-Update Program based on exercises completed.
"I am using the app for my strength workouts, but I can see this applying for people who track their cardio and want to constantly improve themselves.The way I work out and my current problem  I start my programs out with lighter weights, then as I work out and push myself in the gym, I constantly try to increase."
"If I lift more weights one week, I would like that next time I do a specific program I start off at the same point.In other words, the feature is to automatically increase the weight used for an exercise based off what was completed previously.Example Program  Monday  has an exercise  Bench Press  and it is set for 6 reps at a weight of 135 lbs."
"As I complete the program, I end up pushing more  lets say 6 reps at 155 lbs  and this is logged in the app."
"When the user finishes the workout and clicks on  Finish Program , the program automatically gets adjusted with the max weight completed."
"So next time the user does  Monday , the program will ask for 155 lbs instead of the original 135 lbs.I would have that added as a new setting which the user can turn on or off as they wish.Some things that I though of and can be open for discussion Should the weight only increase if the user completed the requested number of reps. From the example above, if the user only did 5 reps of 155, should it still increase the weight of the program or keep it as-is."
I think I would keep the weight until reps are achieved Should we simply have a new popup/dialog that asks the users which ones to update.
"That way even if the user did lift more, he can choose not to update his program, or maybe he will have checkboxes and be able to select which ones to update and which ones to leave.I am new to the code but I can start looking into this if no one opposes."

If the user says  Send it  send the messageIf the user says  Change it  go to step 3 above.At each step when the user gets a voice prompt and doesn t respond within 15 - 20 seconds the App should prompt the user  Could you please repeat what you just said .
If the user doesn t respond or the App doesn t speak any voice input or the app doesn t understand what the user said it should abort with a voice message like  Sorry I m having trouble listening to what you are saying.
Please try again in some time .NOTE  This feature should be activated in Drive Mode only.
